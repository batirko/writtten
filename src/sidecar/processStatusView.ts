/**
 * The control-center activity state — one vocabulary, whichever engine holds the slot.
 *
 * Two jobs, split by part of speech:
 *
 * - **`status` is the verb.** What is happening right now, whichever engine is
 *   selected. One place, said once. The dot mirrors it by one rule: the
 *   states that mean *something is computing* pulse, everything else rests.
 * - **The identity row is the noun.** Which engine is reading — a model name
 *   under the built-in engine, the agent's name under a connected one. It
 *   carries no phase word of its own: an earlier draft had the status row say
 *   "agent reading" while a second row said "reading · 0:20", the same fact
 *   twice in adjacent lines.
 *
 * **Exactly one engine reads the document** (owner, 2026-07-20 —
 * `docs/projects/agent_connected_eval.md` § Engine exclusivity). That is why
 * `engine` is a required input rather than something inferred from whether an
 * agent happens to be attached: an agent's `pass` facts outlive a revoke, so a
 * recently-torn-down source would otherwise keep painting "reading · 0:05" with
 * nothing reading.
 *
 * The dot answers exactly one question: *is something reading my document right
 * now?* That is equally true whether writtten is calling a model or an agent is
 * reviewing, so it gets one vocabulary. An earlier draft gave the agent its own
 * visual channel to avoid "reusing the computation semantics"; that over-applied
 * the rule. The constraint worth keeping is **don't imply progress you can't
 * measure** — it does not follow that "busy" needs a second colour.
 *
 * Three things stay writtten's alone, each for a mechanical reason rather than
 * for symmetry:
 *
 * - **Tier hue** (`fast` blue / `strong` violet) names *which model we called*.
 *   An agent pass has no tier, so `dotTier` keys on our own in-flight count.
 * - **`stalled`** is our stall detector watching our own outstanding calls. It
 *   has nothing to watch on an agent, and an agent that simply stopped is
 *   reported as absent, not as a fault.
 * - **Decay.** Our side resolves because `pending` returns to 0; the agent side
 *   has to resolve itself, because no message ever tells us it finished.
 *
 * `watching` vs `idle` is the distinction the split exists for. Neither is
 * computing, so neither pulses — but one means a critic is attached and will
 * react the moment you type, and the other means nothing is going to happen.
 * Burying that under a name would hide the difference that matters most.
